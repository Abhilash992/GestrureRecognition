# GestrureRecognition

Demo at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4Afc9qcj4I

Implements a simple Convex Hull based gesture recognition and Raspberry Pi GPIO toggling.

Segmentation for convex hull is basic thresholding, hence susceptible to noises. </br>
Take care to run in a controlled environment or feel free to add a better segmentation and use it </br>

# Raspberry Pi connection details,
For 5 fingers, Pin number 38 in board will be high </br>
For 3 fingers, Pin number 40 in board will be high </br>
Both pin Low when fingers closed </br>

# Dependencies
OpenCV     [Linux/Rpi Install: sudo apt-get libopencv-dev ]  </br>
